Google Plugin for Eclipse Terms of Service

1. Your relationship with Google

1.1 Your use of the Google plug-in for Eclipse (referred to as the "Plug-in" in this document) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Google. "Google" means Google Inc., whose principal place of business is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.

1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Google, your agreement with Google will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the "Terms". 

1.3 The Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and Google in relation to your use of the Plug-in. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully.

2. Accepting the Terms

2.1 In order to use the Plug-in, you must first agree to the Terms. You may not use the Plug-in if you do not accept the Terms.

2.2 You can accept the Terms by:

(A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by Google in the user interface (including the download process) for the Plug-in; or

(B) by actually using the Plug-in. In this case, you understand and agree that Google will treat your use of the Plug-in as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

3. Language of the Terms

3.1 Where Google has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with Google.

3.2 If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.

4. Provision of the Plug-in by Google

4.1 Google has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world ("Subsidiaries and Affiliates"). Sometimes, these companies will be providing the Plug-in to you on behalf of Google itself. You acknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Plug-in to you.

4.2 Google is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Plug-in which Google provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.

4.3 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that Google may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Plug-in (or any features within the Plug-in) to you or to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Plug-in at any time. You do not need to specifically inform Google when you stop using the Plug-in.

5. Use of the Plug-in by you

5.1 You agree to use the Plug-in only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the Terms and (b) any applicable law, regulation, third-party terms of service, or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

5.2 You agree that if you use the Plug-in to develop a service for other users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores information submitted by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides you with Google account information, you may only use that information to access the user's Google account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. 

5.3 Unless you have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate agreement with Google, you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade, or resell the Plug-in for any purpose.

5.4 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the Terms and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) of any such breach.

6. Privacy and your personal information

6.1 For information about Google's data protection practices, please read Google's privacy policy at http://www.google.com/privacy.html. This policy explains how Google treats your personal information, and protects your privacy, when you use the Plug-in and related Google services.

6.2 You agree to the use of your data in accordance with Google's privacy policies.

7. Content in the Plug-in

7.1 You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) which you may have access to as part of, or through your use of, the Plug-in are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. All such information is referred to below as the "Content."

7.2 Google reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to pre-screen, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse or remove any or all Content.

7.3 You understand that by using the Plug-in you may be exposed to Content that you may find offensive, indecent or objectionable and that, in this respect, you use the Plug-in at your own risk.

7.4 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any Content that you create, transmit or display while using the Plug-in and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

8. Proprietary rights

8.1 You acknowledge and agree that Google (or Google's licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Plug-in, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Plug-in (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).

8.2 Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Google, nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names, trade marks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.

8.3 If you have been given an explicit right to use any of these brand features in a separate written agreement with Google, then you agree that your use of such features shall be in compliance with that agreement, any applicable provisions of the Terms, and Google's brand feature use guidelines as updated from time to time. These guidelines can be viewed online at http://www.google.com/permissions/guidelines.html (or such other URL as Google may provide for this purpose from time to time).

8.4 Google acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content that you create, submit, post, or display through the Plug-in, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Content which you create, submit, post, or display through the Plug-in.  Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Google, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that Google has no obligation to do so on your behalf.

8.5 You agree that you shall not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trade mark notices) which may be affixed to or contained within the Plug-in.

8.6 Unless you have been expressly authorized to do so in writing by Google, you agree that in using the Plug-in, you will not use any trade mark, service mark, trade name, logo of any company or organization in a way that is likely or intended to cause confusion about the owner or authorized user of such marks, names or logos.

9. License from Google

9.1 Google gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Google (referred to as the "Software" below). This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Plug-in as provided by Google, in the manner permitted by the Terms.

9.2 You may not (and you may not permit anyone else to) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Software or any part thereof, unless this is expressly permitted or required by law, or unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by Google, in writing (e.g., through an open source software license). 

9.3 Unless Google has given you specific written permission to do so (e.g., through an open source software license), you may not assign (or grant a sub-license of) your rights to use the Software, grant a security interest in or over your rights to use the Software, or otherwise transfer any part of your rights to use the Software. 

9.4 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the Plug-in released under an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software license. 

10. Software updates

The Software which you use may automatically download and install updates from time to time from Google. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop the Plug-in and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced functions, new software modules and completely new versions. You agree to receive such updates (and permit Google to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Plug-in.

11. Ending your relationship with Google

11.1 The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as set out below.

11.2 Google may at any time, terminate its legal agreement with you if:

(A) you have breached any provision of the Terms (or have acted in manner which clearly shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Terms); or

(B) Google is required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Plug-in to you is, or becomes, unlawful); or

(C) Google is transitioning to no longer providing the Plug-in to users in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service; or

Your use of these other services, software or goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the company or person concerned. If so, the Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies or individuals.

17.2 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Google and govern your use of the Plug-in (but excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the Plug-in.

17.3 You agree that Google may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Plug-in.

17.4 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

17.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms.

You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
